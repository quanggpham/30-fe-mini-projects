# 30 FE Mini Projects

A collection of 30 front-end mini projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, recreated from the [30 Days HTML CSS JS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLodO7Gi1F7R0zA8RkRHcDgnPduNBmjkb5) YouTube playlist. Created for my personal practice of web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
These projects are built by following tutorials from the playlist, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
